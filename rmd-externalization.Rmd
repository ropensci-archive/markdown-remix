# Code Externalization from R Markdown

Write R code in an external R Markdown, then tangle it and use `read_chunk()` to read its chunks into the current document.
```{r include_chunks, results='hide'}
knitr::purl("foo.Rmd", quiet = TRUE)
knitr::read_chunk("foo.R")
```

List of chunk labels that are now available.
```{r all_labels}
knitr::all_labels()
```

Use the `test` chunk from `read_chunk` -- re-runs code, so `x` changes every time this document knit.
```{r test}
```

Having run that chunk, data from it is available to subsequent chunks.
```{r run-x}
sd(x)
```

Use the `test` chunk from `load_cache` -- re-uses cached values, so `x` doesn't change when this document is knit, but changes when the cache of the external R Markdown is updated.
```{r cached-x}
knitr::load_cache("test", path = "foo_cache/html/")
mean(x)
```
